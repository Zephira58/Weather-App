# 🤔 What's This?
![logo](icon.ico)

Weather App is a simple Python-based application designed to fetch and announce the current weather for two hardcoded locations, Maryborough and Hervey Bay in Queensland, Australia. I built it as a one-off project to help a friend who wanted a weather app with text-to-speech functionality. I have no personal interest in continuing or maintaining this project beyond its initial purpose.
